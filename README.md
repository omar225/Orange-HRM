# Orange HRM Software Testing Project

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to testing the Orange HRM (Human Resource Management) platform. The project aims to explore and implement different software testing methodologies to ensure the system's functionality, security, and performance. As we progress, we will design test cases, automate testing processes, and document findings to enhance the overall quality of the Orange HRM platform.

## Project Scope
Our focus will be on:
- Understanding the Orange HRM system
- Designing and executing test cases
- Implementing automated and manual testing approaches
- Identifying and reporting defects

More details, including the tech stack, test execution, and contribution guidelines, will be added as we advance in the project.
